    "Who am I? You sure you want to know? The story of my life is not for the faint of heart. If somebody said it was a happy little tale, if somebody told you I was just an average ordinary guy, not a care in the world, somebody lied. But let me assure you, this like any story worth telling, is all about a girl. That girl. The girl next door. Mary Jane Watson. The woman I've loved since before I even liked girls. I'd like to tell you that's me next to her. Aw, heck, I'd even take him.",
    "Hey! Stop the bus! That's me. Tell him to stop! Please! Stop! Hey! Stop the bus!",
    "Thank you. I'm sorry I'm late.",
    "Hi, Harry.",
    "It's a great honour to meet you sir.",
    "I read all your research on nanotechnology. Really Brilliant.",
    "Yes, I wrote a paper on it.",
    "I live with my aunt and uncle, they are proud.",
    "He doesn't seem so bad.",
    "That's amazing! This is the most advanced electron microscope in the eastern seaboard. It's unreal.",
    "For the school paper?",
    "Those guys are jerks.",
    "Some spiders change colors to blend into their environment. It's a defense mechanism.",
    "Who wouldn't?",
    "Oh, no. Come on. You talk to her.",
    "Hey, Could I take your picture? I need one with a student in it.",
    "Great.",
    "Yeah, that's great.",
    "That's impossible.",
    "Perfect. - Is that good? - Great. That's great. MJ, let's go!",
    "Wait. Thanks!",
    "I don't feel well. I'm gonna go to sleep.",
    "No thanks, had a bite.",
    "I gotta crash. Everything's fine.",
    "Weird.",
    "Yeah?",
    "I'm fine.",
    "Change? Yep. Big change.",
    "Right. Okay.",
    "I got better. - See? - Bye, guys.",
    "Yeah I've got it.",
    "Sure, Uncle Ben. Don't start without me.",
    "Hi, MJ. Hey, MJ I don't know if you realize this, but we've been neighbors since I was 6. And I was wondering if we could get together sometime? I got the car. Hop in. Do something fun? Or, I don't know. I thought it'd be time to get to know each other. Or not.",
    "Stop the bus!",
    "Tell him to stop.",
    "No problem.",
    "I don't want to fight you Flash.",
    "Go, web! Fly. Up, up and away, web. Shazam! Go! Go! Go, web, go!",
    "Tallyho.",
    "No. Well, I heard, but I was just taking out the trash.",
    "Everybody shouts.",
    "Oh, they can scream pretty good sometimes. Listen, MJ, about today at school with Flash...",
    "I'm sorry. Is he okay?",
    "I wanna move into the city. And hopefully, get a job as a photographer. Work my way through college. What about you?",
    "What? No, come on. Try me.",
    "Really? Oh, that's perfect. You were awesome in all the school plays.",
    "Yeah. I cried like a baby when you played Cinderella.",
    "Well even so. Sometimes you know people. You can just see what's coming.",
    "I don't know. Whatever it is, it's something I never felt before.",
    "For you? You're gonna light up Broadway.",
    "I hunch.",
    "Bye.",
    "Cool car.",
    "I'm exercising. I'm not dressed, Aunt May.",
    "Okay. Thanks.",
    "I'm going to the downtown library, I'll see you later.",
    "I'll take the train.",
    "Thanks for the ride, Uncle Ben.",
    "We can talk later.",
    "What do we have to talk about? Why now?",
    "I didn't start that fight, I told you that.",
    "What was I supposed to do, run away?",
    "No. Not exactly.",
    "Are you afraid that I'm going to turn into some kind of criminal? Quit worrying about me, okay? Something's different. I'll figure it out. Stop lecturing, please.",
    "Then stop pretending to be!",
    "Yes.",
    "The Human Spider.",
    "Yeah.",
    "My Name's the Human Spider.",
    "No, he got my name wrong.",
    "Hello? Guys?",
    "Hey listen! This is some kind of mistake. I didn't sign up for a cage match! Unlock the thing! Take the chain off!",
    "Staying away from you. That's a cute outfit. Did your husband give it to you?",
    "A hundred bucks? The ad said 3000.",
    "I need that money.",
    "I missed the part where that's my problem.",
    "Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.",
    "That's my uncle! What happened?",
    "Uncle Ben? Uncle Ben. Uncle Ben?",
    "I'm here, Uncle Ben.",
    "What about my uncle? Did you give him a chance? Did you? Answer me!",
    "Oh that's great!",
    "Yeah.",
    "No, thanks.",
    "I missed him a lot today.",
    "I can't help thinking about the last thing I said to him. He tried to tell me something important, and I threw it in his face.",
    "Hey!",
    "MJ, it's me, Peter.",
    "I'm begging for a job. How about you?",
    "An audition? So you're acting now?",
    "That's great MJ. You're doing it. Living your dream.",
    "It's nothing to be embarrassed about.",
    "Don't tell Harry?",
    "Don't you guys live together?",
    "And I won't tell Harry.",
    "I won't. I won't tell Harry.",
    "I was late for work and Dr. Connors fired me.",
    "Around.",
    "Well, sorry. Harry hasn't mentioned her.",
    "Menace? He was protecting that...",
    "Yes, sir.",
    "I'd like a job, sir.",
    "Hi.",
    "Mr. Jameson told me to give that to you.",
    "Thank you. I'm Peter Parker. I'm a photographer.",
    "Come on. Move, kid.",
    "Oh, boy.",
    "Mary Jane!",
    "Hold on!",
    "Hold on Mary Jane! [pause] Well, beats taking the subway. Don't mind us. She just needs to use the elevator.",
    "You know who I am.",
    "Your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.",
    "You're right. I didn't.",
    "I'm gonna stay up for a while.",
    "I don't know. Whatever it is, somebody has to stop it.",
    "Mr. Jameson Spider-Man...",
    "Spider-Man wasn't attacking the city he was trying to save it. That's slander.",
    "Set him down, tough guy.",
    "Hey, kiddo, let Mom and Dad talk for a minute, will you?.",
    "I'm not like you. You're a murderer.",
    "Because it's right.",
    "It's me again. How was your audition?",
    "The hot line. Your mom told my aunt, told me. So you just came by? I was in the neighborhood. Needed to see a friendly face. I took two buses and a cab to get in the neighborhood, but... So how'd it go? They said I needed acting lessons. A soap opera told me I needed acting lessons. Let me buy you a cheeseburger. The sky's the limit, up to $7.84. I'd like a cheeseburger. Oh, but I'm going out to dinner with Harry. Come with us. No, thanks. How's it going with...? Never mind. That's none of my business. It's not? Why so interested? I'm not. You're not? - Well, why would I be? - I don't know. Why would you be? I, that's a... I don't know. Sorry you won't come with us. I'd better run, tiger. Hey, check it out, man. Come on, man. Hey, where you going, baby? Come on! Get off me! Wait! You have a knack for getting in trouble. You have a knack for saving my life. I think I have a superhero stalker. I was in the neighborhood. You are amazing. Some people don't think so. - But you are. - Nice to have a fan. Do I get to say thank you this time? Wait. I have to get in there! My baby's in there! My baby's in there! - Let me go! - I can't let you in there, the roof's about to collapse. - Somebody save my baby! - The roof's about to collapse! Look! Up there! Save my baby, please! No! - It's okay. Your baby's fine. - Oh, my baby! God bless you, Spider-Man. Bless you. Don't let him get away! Hold it right there! You're under arrest. I'm taking you in. Oh, my God, there's somebody still up there! I'm going. - I'll be here when you get back. - Not coming back chief. Go! Go! Where are you? Where are you? I'm gonna get you out of here! It's okay. You're pathetically predictable. Like a moth to the flame. What about my generous proposal?",
    "Hey, everyone.",
    "Sorry I'm late. It's a jungle out there. I had to beat an old lady with a stick to get these cranberries.",
    "Oh, yeah, I stepped off a curb and got clipped by one of those bike messengers.",
    "No, it's nothing.",
    "Bike messenger. Knocked me down.",
    "Aunt May. Is she gonna be okay? What happened?",
    "What happened?",
    "He knows who I am.",
    "She's going to be fine. She's been sleeping all day. Thanks for coming.",
    "Yeah, I'm fine. I just felt bad about leaving Aunt May. Have you talked to Harry?",
    "You are? At least I think I am.",
    "No. Go on. Would I know his name, this guy?",
    "Trust me.",
    "Oh. Him.",
    "No, I understand. He is extremely cool.",
    "No, no, not Spider-Man, not a chance in the world. I know him a little bit. I'm sort of his unofficial photographer.",
    "Yeah.",
    "I said... He asked me what I thought about you.",
    "I said, \"Spider-Man.\" I said, \"The great thing about MJ is when you look in her eyes and she's looking back in yours everything feels not quite normal. Because you feel stronger and weaker at the same time. You feel excited and at the same time terrified. The truth is, you don't know what you feel except you know what kind of man you want to be. It's as if you've reached the unreachable and you weren't ready for it.\"",
    "Well, something like that.",
    "And you look beautiful.",
    "I don't like to leave you here.",
    "Can I do anything for you?",
    "Hey, you were supposed to be asleep.",
    "Gee, did I say that?",
    "Well, Harry's in love with her. She's still his girl.",
    "MJ, it's Peter. You there? Hello? You there? I'm just calling to check up on you. Will you call me when you get in? All right, well... Don't... Don't go up any dark alleys. Hello?",
    "Where is she? What is that?",
    "Goblin, what have you done?",
    "Don't do it, Goblin!",
    "Listen. I need you to climb down.",
    "Yes, you can! MJ, you can do it. You have to. Trust me. Hold on tight and go quickly. - Hurry!",
    "Hang on, Mary Jane!",
    "Mr. Osborn.",
    "You killed those people on that balcony.",
    "You tried to kill Aunt May. You tried to kill Mary Jane.",
    "I have a father. His name was Ben Parker.",
    "I'm so sorry, Harry. I know what it's like to lose a father.",
    "No matter what I do, no matter how hard I try, the ones I love will always be the ones who pay.",
    "It's been so hard without him.",
    "Really?",
    "All I wanted was to tell her how much I loved her.",
    "I can't.",
    "Tell you... Everything. I mean, there's so much to tell.",
    "I will always be there to take care of you. I promise you that. I will always be your friend.",
    "That's all I have to give.",
    "Whatever life holds in store for me... I will never forget these words, \"With great power comes great responsibility\". This is my gift. My curse. Who am I? I'm Spider-Man."
